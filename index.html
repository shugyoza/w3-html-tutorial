  <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <h2>This is H2 Heading</h2>
      <h3>This is H3 Heading</h3>
        <h4>This is H4 Heading</h4>
          <h5>This is H5 Heading</h5>
            <h6>This is H6 Heading</h6>

  <p>My first paragraph. I wrote everything with only plain text editor.</p>
  <p>This is another paragraph!</p>

  <p>OK, enough of playing! This is html link using a tag! Click this link: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">https://www.w3schools.com</a> darling!
  </p>

  <p>
    We are using img tag to display image here:
    <img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">
    Oops! It is broken because I only wrote img src="w3schools.jpg" for the tag, when in fact there is no file with that name stored in the same directory with this index.html file!

    <img src="https://www.sephora.com/contentimages/brands/jlo-beauty/JLO%20Beauty-brand-tile-460x772..jpg" alt="Photo of JLo Advertisement" width="104" height="142">
    Now we're talking! lol! So instead of just putting a file name that refer to a file that resides in the same folder as index.html, I wrote ..img src="https://www.sephora.com/contentimages/brands/jlo-beauty/JLO%20Beauty-brand-tile-460x772..jpg" .. for the img tag.</p>
